- Nodejs uses non-blocking feature for handling I/O operations asynchronously. Instaed of waiting for an I/O operation to complete. It uses callbacks, promises or async/await to handle the response when its ready.
- Nodejs follows non-buffering, its best for memory efficiency, scalability and latency reduction due it processes in chunks instead of waiting for the entire data set to be recieved before processing.
